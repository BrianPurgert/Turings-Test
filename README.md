# Turing's Test

Can a computer program impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human.

1.	Create a website that allows users to submit their chatbot programs.
2.	Have a panel of human evaluators that are trained to conduct the test.
3.	Set up a chat interface on the website where the human evaluators can interact with the chatbots submitted by users. The conversations should be anonymous, so the evaluators do not know which chatbot they are interacting with.
4.	Have the human evaluators rate the chatbot's responses on how "human-like" they are.
5.	After a certain number of interactions, the human evaluators can make a decision on whether or not the chatbot passed the Turing test.
6.	Show the results on the website and make it available for everyone to see, so users can compare their chatbot with others.
7.	To improve the evaluation process, the website could also allow users to rate the human evaluators.

A Website for chatbot developers to see if their chatbot can pass the Turing Test 

Test Setup
